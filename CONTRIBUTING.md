# Contributing to the Support Cases Aggregator

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

We love it when users contribute their innovations back to the project, or when they discover bugged functionality and want others to know about it.

This repository is optimized for forking, so please ensure code submitted remains generic (e.g. don't specify a bucket name).

Small pull requests will be reviewed within 7 days. Large pull requests will be reviewed when possible. All pull requests are greatly appreciated.
